# AI Sonnet

![alt text](images/demo.gif)

The AI Shakespeare Sonnet Generator is a web application that utilizes a deep learning model running on the server to generate Shakespearean-style sonnets. Users can input an initial prompt, specify the temperature for generating text, and set the desired length of the sequence to be generated.

## Features 

- Deep Learning Model: The application leverages a deep learning model trained on Shakespearean texts to generate sonnets.
- Express and Node.js: Built with Express.js and Node.js for the server-side functionality.
- User Input: Users can provide an initial prompt to guide the generation process.
- Temperature Control: The temperature parameter adjusts the creativity and randomness of the generated text.
- Sequence Length: Users can specify the length of the sequence to be generated.

## Dataset

This Model is based on all of Shakespeares Sonnets as its dataset. The book can be found under Project Gutenberg: [Sonnet Collection](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1041)
